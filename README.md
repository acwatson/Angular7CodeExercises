# SeatAssignment UI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

## Exercises

  1. Implement all of the steps marked with "TODO" comments in the "seatClicked" method of app.component.ts.
  
  1. As a bonus, add unit tests to app.component.spec.ts that will test your code changes from the previous step.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
